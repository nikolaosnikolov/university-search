# university-search
# What it does?
  This is a project that has a lot of functions included. I have created two arrays that are having some static data. There are three prompts that ask: username,
  password and the name of university you want to see (only Harvard University, Princeton University, Yale University and MIT). Once your data are valid, you
  can put the name of the university and then there is a new table opened with all the data for this university you may try to find.
# How this can be used?
  Of course it's just static now, but later when we are going to put MongoDB and back-end communication it can be used as a website for those who are searching material for their dream school.
  Of course it needs a lot of CSS changes to be better and a lot of DOM changes. This was just to make practise for arrays and function together with HTML and CSS.
